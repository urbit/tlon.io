# dev
$ yarn run dev
# runs 2 dev commands in parallel:
#   - watches css/style.css and builds to static/style.css
#     on changes (for tailwind)
#   - runs `zola serve` and serves the frontend to
#     http://localhost:1111

# build
$ yarn run build
# builds and minifies css/style.css to public/style.css
# and then runs `zola build` to build the rest of the site
