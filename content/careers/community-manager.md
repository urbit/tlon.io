**About Tlon / Urbit**

Tlon is one of the companies working on Urbit, a new platform for personal computing in the cloud. Urbit is a decentralized identity system (Urbit ID) and a network of personal servers (Urbit OS) designed for individual day to day communication, collaboration and commerce. You can learn more about Urbit and try it out at urbit.org.

While Tlon helps to build the core infrastructure of Urbit, its focus is on tools and products for communities that run on top of Urbit. The first of those was Groups, a flexible communication tool at the intersection of Discord, are.na, and Notion that we launched in 2020. The second is Tlon Hosting Services, the easiest way to run an Urbit OS node. The third is a mobile version of Landscape, called Pocket.

Tlon is a focused, dedicated team of people. We’re excited about a future where we actually control our computers again. Getting there is going to involve a lot of rigorous work, and we’re excited to do it.

**About Community**

Mostly we don’t do marketing. We just help communities. Urbit is inherently social in its architecture. Nodes connect to other nodes: sharing data and collaborating is the primary advantage of a networked computer. We build products for digital communities on Urbit…not in the Stockholm-syndrome, attention seeking, centralized way of companies like Discord or FAANG. At Tlon, we build products that are calm, durable, and forever yours. Community is central to everything we create at Tlon Corp.
