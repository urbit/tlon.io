**About Tlon / Urbit**

Tlon is one of the companies working on Urbit, a new platform for *personal* computing in the cloud. Urbit is a decentralized identity system (Urbit ID) and a network of personal servers (Urbit OS) designed for individual day to day communication, collaboration and commerce. You can learn more about Urbit and try it out at [urbit.org](https://urbit.org).

While Tlon helps to build the core infrastructure of Urbit, its focus is on tools and products for communities that run on top of Urbit. The first of those was Landscape, a flexible communication tool at the intersection of Discord, are.na, and Notion that we launched in 2020. The second is Tlon Hosting Services, the easiest way to run an Urbit OS node. The third is a mobile version of Landscape, called Pocket.

Tlon is a focused, dedicated team of people. We’re excited about a future where we actually control our computers again. Getting there is going to involve a lot of rigorous work, and we’re excited to do it.
