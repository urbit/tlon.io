## About Tlon:

Urbit is a social OS for everyone. Currently, most people run their Urbit on their own machine, but this won’t work for the masses. People need an easy way to get onto the network, and Tlon hosting is building the product and platform to provide that. We are committed to becoming the primary infrastructure company for Urbit, hopefully managing millions of Urbit instances in the future. You will be joining a small team that is laying the foundation to build an ambitious and profitable business, which means you can have a big impact, and not only at Tlon, but on Urbit at large.

## About the job:

We want an experienced full stack developer that can deliver new hosting features end-to-end. Since we are working on an infrastructure platform, much of what we do is not visible to our customers, but we still need to package it as a high quality product. You will work on our React frontend and on our Haskell backend, which includes the APIs and all the infrastructure code that runs hosting. As Urbit scales to many more users, of which many will be on our hosting platform, you will need to engineer systems and services that are designed with scale, stability, and security in mind. 

The position and team is 100% remote. Most of us work in Europe time zones, but we are flexible on where you work from. We do multiple offsites every year where we get to spend time IRL as a team and with everyone else at Tlon.

## You will:

- Customer and user onboarding flows. From things like signup, to enabling people to bring their own Urbit IDs or existing Urbit ships, to special invite mechanics.
- Restructuring of the current customer dashboard
- Admin tools so we can run our hosting operation efficiently
- Internal analytics and dashboards
- APIs for external developers, teams, and companies
- Developer tools so that people who are building on Urbit can use our hosting platform too.
- Blockchain interactions to enable automatic spawning of planets and maintenance of existing stars and planets.
- Many other exciting initiatives, which we are not publicly sharing right now :-)


## What we're looking for:

- A proven track record of delivering high-quality infrastructure or platform products. Ideally, show us a portfolio of projects you have worked on.
- A well rounded engineer that has a functional programming background.
- Experience with Haskell or is willing to learn it. If not Haskell, working experience with another functional language such as Clojure, OCaml, F#, or Scala.
- Ability to get up to speed quickly with our tech stack: Nix and Bazel development and build environment, React frontend, Haskell backend and infrastructure code, Kubernetes to run Urbit ships and other infrastructure, Google Cloud Platform.
- Ideally some familiarity with Urbit, and an understanding why building a hosting platform is an important next step for Urbit at large.

## Please include in your application:

- A resume and/or LinkedIn profile
- An introduction note: This is your opportunity to tell us about yourself, why you’re interested in Urbit and Tlon
