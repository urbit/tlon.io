~ I’m Marisa, also known as ~riprud-tidmel, VP of Product at Tlon Corp, and the person hiring for this role. If you join our team as the CX manager, we’d work closely together. 

My quick pitch for this role is if you want to support communities in creating and capturing 100% of their own data, value, and potential then join us at Tlon. Perhaps you have nostalgia (or anemoia) for a time when the internet was still made up of real people. We’re reclaiming the internet with one computer (Urbit), one OS (Landscape), one product (Groups), and one community  at a time. You’d join a team of talented, obsessed, and unique individuals working on rebuilding the personal computer for the 21st century. Help digital communities on Urbit create their real homes, club houses, HQs and leave behind the algorithmic, attention-seeking, spam-laden, centralized way of MEGACORPs.

I think this role is a good fit if you:

- are ready for a career defining role
- are a people person
- care about what Tlon is building, and are passionate about creating an amazing customer experience for communities
- are excited to build, mentor, and lead a CX team
- have experience managing people and projects
- have experience with communications, media, and tech
- align with these values: https://urbit.org/blog/beliefs-and-principles
