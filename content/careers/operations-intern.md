Tlon is hiring an Operations intern. This position will require a commitment of at least three months. You will report to our Operations team and will be asked to attend two weekly meetings and to meet 1:1 with team members as needed.

## About Tlon:

Tlon is one of the companies working on Urbit, a new platform for personal computing in the cloud. Urbit is a decentralized identity system (Urbit ID) and a network of personal servers (Urbit OS) designed for individual day to day communication, collaboration and commerce. You can learn more about Urbit and try it out at [urbit.org](http://urbit.org).

While Tlon helps to build the core infrastructure of Urbit, our focus is on tools and products for communities that run on top of Urbit. The first of those was Groups, a flexible communication tool at the intersection of Discord, [are.na](http://are.na), and Notion that we launched in 2020. The second is Tlon Hosting Services, the easiest way to run an Urbit OS node.

Tlon is a dedicated team of people. We’re excited about a future where we actually control our computers again. Getting there is going to involve a lot of rigorous work and we’re excited to do it.

## About the Ops team:

We keep Tlon running smoothly; manage internal programs for employee support and morale; and analyze external factors related to fundraising, corporate strategy, etc. Since Urbit is a project with a broad scope, we observe and strategize about the world around us. The ideal intern would be somebody who enjoys doing in-depth research into both theoretical and real-world conditions (technological, economic, and geopolitical), is good at hitting self-created milestones, and can parse the difference between map and territory.

## About You:

You’re an energetic go-getter who wants to learn. You’re passionate about Urbit, and are excited to work with a variety of people on diverse projects. You pride yourself on your attention to detail and flexibility, and you enjoy working with others. You have a variety of interests and are a team player.

## What you'll do:

- Synthesize and present regular updates on market conditions, regulatory news, and the funding landscape to Tlon Ops staff
- Assist with research on possible crypto protocol integrations and use cases for Urbit ID and the Urbit network
- Assist with research, ideation, and outreach to academics and economic analysts around creating sophisticated models of Urbit valuation and commercial potential
- Assist with in-person outreach at conferences and campus events with an eye to recruiting
- Assist with other Ops-related duties as needed
    
## Requirements:

- Excellent written communication, attention to detail, and ability to summarize lengthy documents
- Basic knowledge of crypto protocols/decentralized tech, equity and crypto markets and macro conditions, regulatory environment, and fundraising practices (both crypto-native and traditional venture capital)
- Excellent interpersonal skills
- Ability and desire to communicate with a wide range of people
- Networking and outreach experience
    
## Nice-to-Haves:

- Deep technical knowledge of Urbit, blockchains, or programming languages is *not* a prerequisite for this position, but enthusiasm for and generally up-to-date knowledge of the cryptocurrency and decentralized web space is a big plus.

## Compensation + time commitment:

This is a paid internship. Interns will be expected to work at least half-time on average, with the potential for full-time depending on our staffing needs. The length of internship is somewhat flexible, but requires a minimum 3-month commitment. They will be expected to write digests of their weekly activity and submit invoices at the end of each monthly period.

## Location:

We are open to remote candidates, but preference may be given to a San Francisco Bay Area candidate. The ability to travel and do some in-person outreach will be required for this position.

Application process: Please write a statement (one page or less) on your interest in the position, relevant experience, knowledge of/involvement with the Urbit project, and time/location availability; attach your resume, and send both to apply [@tlon.io](mailto:corrina@tlon.io) as attachments.
