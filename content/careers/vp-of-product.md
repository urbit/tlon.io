## About Tlon

Tlon is one of the companies working on Urbit, a new platform for personal computing in the cloud. Urbit is a decentralized identity system (Urbit ID) and a network of personal servers (Urbit OS) designed for individual day to day communication, collaboration, and commerce. You can learn more about Urbit and try it out at [urbit.org](https://urbit.org).

While Tlon helps to build the core infrastructure of Urbit, its focus is on tools and products for communities that run on top of Urbit.  The first of those was Landscape, a flexible communication tool at the intersection of Discord, are.na, and Notion that we launched in 2020. The second is Tlon Hosting Services, which makes running an Urbit node as easy as any conventional app. The third is a mobile messenger called Pocket. We also contribute to Bridge, the open-source tool for interacting with Urbit ID.

Urbit is general-purpose open source infrastructure. Tlon works to build approachable, understandable products on top of it. Building products on top of this new platform forces the core Urbit infrastructure to become more stable, reliable, and mature. 

Our product efforts tend to be cross-cutting, often involving everything from visual design to core infrastructure and kernel development. For Urbit to succeed it must be exceptional from both a user experience standpoint and in terms of technical architecture and execution. 

Tlon is a focused, dedicated team of people. We’re excited about a future where we actually control our computers again. Getting there is going to involve a lot of rigorous work, and we’re excited to do it.


**Role**

The VP of Product works with our CTO and CEO to define and maintain our product roadmap, then works with our interface and infrastructure teams to coordinate, get things built, and ship them. They will also work closely with the VP of Marketing and Communications to coordinate product releases and messaging. Specifically this involves developing project specifications, managing teams and their timelines, and coordinating reviews with stakeholders. 

Doing this job well involves a thorough understanding of the technology we use, an appreciation of the aesthetic refinement we strive for, the ability to empathize with users, an obsession with product management and process, and excellent communication and organizational skills. This position will be in charge of building out a team of product managers for our current product suites (Landscape, Pocket, Bridge, Urbit ID, and Hosting) and contributing to the evolving culture of Tlon and Urbit.

**Requirements**

Above all, we’re looking for someone with experience coordinating tough technical projects with exacting user experience requirements. Even better if you have experience doing this with something that’s either a platform or an open-ended tool.

- Bachelor’s degree in a relevant field (either CS, design or HCI)
- 5+ years experience in a similar industry
- 4+ years experience in Product Management leadership with 3+ direct reports
- Significant experience shepherding products through their entire lifecycle: designing, building, launching and maintaining them. Even better if those products are extensible or developer oriented
- Deep understanding of and familiarity with the frontend web stack
- Familiarity with C, Haskell, and systems programming

We have hired quite a lot of people out of the Urbit Community. This isn’t a requirement, but all applicants should be familiar with Urbit both technically and the existing community on the network. To get up to speed:

- Read: Our docs, but especially [Understanding Urbit](https://urbit.org/understanding-urbit)
- Listen: to Arthur Falls’ [Understanding Urbit podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/understanding-urbit/id1504188804)
