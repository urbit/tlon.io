We are seeking a Director of Financial Planning & Analysis to join the Operations team at Tlon! 

## About Tlon / Urbit

Tlon is one of the companies working on Urbit, a new platform for personal computing in the cloud. Urbit is a decentralized identity system (Urbit ID) and a network of personal servers (Urbit OS) designed for individual day to day communication, collaboration and commerce. You can learn more about Urbit and try it out at urbit.org.

While Tlon helps to build the core infrastructure of Urbit, our focus is on building tools and products for communities that run on top of Urbit. The first of those was Groups, a flexible communication tool at the intersection of Discord, are.na, and Notion that we launched in 2020. The second is Tlon Hosting Services, the easiest way to run an Urbit OS node. The third is a mobile version of Landscape, called Pocket.

Tlon is a focused, dedicated team of people. We’re excited about a future where we actually control our computers again. Getting there is going to involve a lot of rigorous work, and we’re excited to do it.

## About Operations

Operations is the non-technical arm of a very technical company. We run the business as a business, and make sure the technical departments have the resources they need to be able to focus. More specifically, operations at Tlon are responsible for finance and fundraising, legal, people, and facilities. We’re a small and very dynamic team. You'll be reporting directly to the Chief Operations Officer.

## About You

You are first and foremost someone who can get a job done with limited direction. You like people and you get along well with your peers. You get the numbers, and can see implications of those numbers on real people, and on the actual business. You are therefore detail oriented. You are up to speed on the DeFi, tradfi, and crypto landscapes, and you can think in both macro and micro terms with regards to financial projections.

## What you'll do:

- Manage Tlon’s investor relations program, and facilitate ongoing communications with Tlon investors and address space owners.
- Work with the COO to create and maintain financial models for business units within the company.
- Work with the COO and CEO to develop investor presentations.
- Work with bookkeeping and accounting to maintain internal projects.
- Manage business and address space valuation projects, and work with outside experts to facilitate development of third party valuation frameworks.
- Research new and emerging business opportunities and models for Urbit generally, and Tlon specifically.

## Requirements:

- 3+ years experience in either operations, finance, or investor relations
- Strong written and verbal skills (English)
- Strong spreadsheet skill set
- A deep understanding of financial models and projections
- Familiarity with the web3 / DAO / decentralized web ecosystem

## Nice to haves:

- Experience managing a small team
- Already on Urbit!

## Please include in your application

- A resume and LinkedIn profile
- A one-page writing sample, and at least one of the following:
- A business plan written exclusively by you;
- A financial model developed entirely by you;
- An investor presentation drafted primarily by you.
