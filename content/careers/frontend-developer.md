*Tlon Corporation is a design and engineering company
building simple and beautiful digital environments for Urbit —*

*— Urbit is a reimagination of the networked personal computer
and is built entirely from scratch using new programming languages,
p2p networking architectures, and cryptographic identity.*

As Tlon, our goal is to comprehensively develop a useful, simple, and easy-to-use ecosystem of software using Urbit as our foundation. Urbit's new and unique architecture presents both old and new problems to solve that require a range of talented individuals with fresh ideas.

## About you:

You are a front-end software engineer who can put yourself in the shoes of the user. You think practically about what UI would best serve the user. You are well-versed in front-end web development and communicate well with people who aren't. You can conceive of simple and resilient solutions and are responsive to production issues. You have excellent communication skills and can collaborate with others in a remote working environment. 

## About the job:

As a front-end software engineer you'll primarily be creating application UI for a large portion of the Urbit ecosystem. You'll be collaborating with users, userspace devs, and our product and marketing teams to leverage the value that Urbit brings as a networked personal computer. You'll also play a large part in directing and guiding the future of user interfaces in the Urbit ecosystem, as well as help develop our engineering culture and practices.

You'll report to Hunter Miller, our UI Engineering Manager. 

## Responsibilities

- Create and maintain Urbit application UI for the majority of the Urbit ecosystem
- Build and maintain core Tlon front-end libraries and infrastructure
- Develop and ensure engineering quality is maintained to a high degree
- Scope, design, lead, and collaborate on technical projects; lay the groundwork for early-stage products to grow
- Collaborate with other team members at Tlon to solve the unique problems that Urbit's new software and networking model present

## Requirements

- Have 2+ years of relevant experience
- Have experience with modern front-end web development workflows and toolchains (eg. React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Vite/Webpack)
- Can foresee cross-browser compatibility issues and client-side performance considerations
- Can operate autonomously on complex projects involving brand new tech which may not have documentation
- Have ideas about the future of UI and how we can bring native UIs to Urbit

## Nice to Haves

- Have experience using Urbit, running and operating ships
- Familiarity with Hoon and Gall agents
- Experience building UI in other languages and platforms, especially native desktop and mobile
- Experience working with design systems and collaborating directly with designers to achieve visual consistency
