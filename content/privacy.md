Tlon Corporation ('Tlon,' 'we,' 'our,' and/or 'us') values the privacy of individuals who use Urbit software, our websites, and related services (collectively, our 'Services'). This privacy policy (the 'Privacy Policy') explains how we collect, use, and share information from users of our Services ('Users'). By using our Services, you agree to the collection, use, disclosure, and procedures this Privacy Policy describes. Beyond the Privacy Policy, your use of our Services is also subject to our [Terms of Service](/terms).

**Information we collect**

We may collect a variety of information from or about you or your devices from various sources, as described below.

**Information you provide to us**

*Address Space Information.* When you acquire Urbit address space from Tlon, you provide us with certain information, such as your name and email. You may also provide us with your Ethereum wallet address and public key.

*Communications.* If you contact us directly, we may receive additional information about you. For example, when you chat with us in Urbit or contact support, we may receive your email address, the contents of a message or attachments that you may send to us, and other information you choose to provide.

*Information from Cookies and Similar Technologies.* On our websites, we and third party partners collect information using cookies, pixel tags, or similar technologies. Our third party partners, such as analytics and advertising partners, may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across different online services. Cookies are small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to our website.

Please review your web browser 'Help' file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Services, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Services to their fullest potential.

**How we use the information we collect**

We use the information we collect:

1. To provide and maintain our Services
2. To understand and analyze how you use the Services, and to improve and enhance our Services and develop new products, services, features, and functionality;
3. To communicate with you, to provide you with updates and other information relating to the Services, to provide information that you request, to respond to comments and questions, and otherwise provide customer support;
4. To find and prevent fraud;
5. To respond to trust and safety issues that may arise;

7. For other purposes for which we provide specific notice at the time of the collection of the information.


**How we share the information we collect**

We do not share or otherwise disclose information we collect from or about you except as described below or otherwise disclosed to you at the time of the collection.

*On the Blockchain.* If you purchase address space, we may publish information about that purchase to the Ethereum blockchain, including your public key and Urbit address. We will never publish your name or email address to the blockchain.

*Vendors and Service Providers.* We may share any information we receive with vendors and service providers retained in connection with the provision of the Service.

*Analytics Partners.* We use analytics services such as Google Analytics to collect and process certain analytics data. These services may also collect information regarding your use of other websites, apps, and online resources. You can learn about Google's practices by going to <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>, and opt out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.

*As Required By Law and Similar Disclosures.* We may access, preserve, and disclose your information if we believe doing so is required or appropriate to (a) comply with law enforcement requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; (b) respond to your requests; or (c) protect your, our or others' rights, property, or safety. For the avoidance of doubt, the disclosure of your information may occur if you post any objectionable content on or through the Service.

*Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers.* We may transfer your information to service providers, advisors, potential transactional partners, or other third parties in connection with the consideration, negotiation, or completion of a corporate transaction in which we are acquired by or merged with another company or we sell, liquidate, or transfer all or a portion of our assets. The use of your information following any of these events will be governed by the provisions of this Privacy Policy in effect at the time the applicable information was collected.

*Consent.* We may also disclose your information with your permission.

**Your choices**

*Marketing Communications.* You can unsubscribe from our promotional emails via the link provided in the emails. Even if you opt-out of receiving promotional messages from us, you will continue to receive administrative messages from us.

*Do Not Track.* There is no accepted standard on how to respond to Do Not Track signals, and we do not respond to such signals.

**Third parties**

The Services may contain links to other websites, products, or services that Tlon does not own or operate. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties. Please be aware that this Privacy Policy will not apply to your activities or any information you disclose to these third parties. We encourage you to read their privacy policies before providing any information to them.

**Security**

We make reasonable efforts to protect your information by using physical and electronic safeguards designed to improve the security of the information we maintain. However, as our Services are hosted electronically, we can make no guarantees as to the security or privacy of your information.

**Children's privacy**

We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or use personal information from children under 13 years of age, and no part of the Service is directed to children. If you learn that a child has provided us with personal information in violation of this Privacy Policy, then you may alert us at privacy@tlon.io.

**International visitors**

The Services are hosted in the United States and are intended for visitors located within the United States. If you choose to use the Services from the European Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, then please note that you are transferring your personal information outside of those regions to the United States for storage and processing. Also, we may transfer your data from the U.S. to other countries or regions in connection with storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating the Services. By providing any information, including personal information, on or to the Services, you consent to such transfer, storage, and processing.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

We will post any adjustments to the Privacy Policy on this page, and the revised version will be effective when it is posted. If we materially change the ways in which we use or share personal information previously collected from you through the Services, we will notify you through the Services, by email, or other communication.

**Contact information**

Tlon is responsible for processing your information. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about our processing activities, please email us at [privacy@tlon.io](mailto:privacy@tlon.io).
