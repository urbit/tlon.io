## Scope of this Privacy Policy

Tlon Corporation ('Tlon,' 'we,' 'our,' and/or 'us') values the privacy of individuals who use Tlon
Hosting, Urbit software, our websites, and other Tlon offerings and related services (collectively,
our 'Services'). This privacy policy (the 'Privacy Policy') explains how we collect, use, and share
information from users of our Services ('Users'). By using our Services, you understand and
agree to the collection, use, disclosure, and procedures this Privacy Policy describes. Beyond
the Privacy Policy, your use of our Services is also subject to our Terms of Service.

#### Your privacy matters

At Urbit, we care about your privacy and believe that ownership, privacy and control don’t need
to be sacrificed in exchange for usability, accessibility and reliability. That’s why we limit our
collection and use of your personally identifiable information (“PII”) to what’s necessary to
provide our Services to you, unless you give us your consent.

### Information we collect

We may collect a variety of information from or about you or your devices from various sources,
as described below. We collect information: 1) when you provide it to us or give us permission to
collect it; and 2) automatically, when you interact with the Services.

#### 1. Information you provide to us

_Address Space Information._ When you acquire Urbit address space from Tlon, you voluntarily
provide us with certain information, such as your name and email. You may also provide us with
your Ethereum wallet address and public key.


_Communications._ If you contact us directly, we may receive additional information about you.
For example, when you chat with us in Urbit or contact support, we may receive your email
address, the contents of a message or attachments that you may send to us, and other
information you choose to provide.

#### 2. Information we automatically collect when you use our services

When you use or interact with our Services, certain information is automatically collected and
logged.

your interactions, how you used our Services, cookie data, device data, occurrences of
technical errors, diagnostic reports, your settings preferences, backup information, and
API calls.

improve them, if you let us, we automatically receive information about your interactions
with the Services, like the full Uniform Resource Locators (URL) clickstream to, through,

times of your visits. Page response times, download erros, and page interaction
information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs)
