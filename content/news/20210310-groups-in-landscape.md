It’s been almost a year since we released OS1, the first public draft of Landscape, into the wider world of the Urbit network. From inside the project, it feels like much more time has elapsed. When you’re focused on the task of building a new world, it can be easy to forget just how far you’ve come. 

Urbit is speedrunning the creation of a new Internet. We’ve looked up from some question of design, intention, or implementation more times than we can count, and found ourselves in 1975 or 1981 or 2008, trying to answer the same questions with the wisdom of the intervening years. This is true for the underlying infrastructure, for the expanding options that Landscape users have, and in the growth of real communities on Urbit.  

This gets fractal — each new piece of code, visual design, or UX decision made also reflects both an understanding of computing history, and a “let’s see if we’re right” spirit of testing out our hunches about how things could be different, on a different network, optimized for different qualities. 

One year ago, Urbit itself was slow and buggy, and the social dimension was almost entirely self-referential. There were a few chats and notebooks where people could gather, but almost all the discussions were about technical improvements to Urbit itself, and almost all the participants were Urbit developers or Tlon employees. It’s been utterly fascinating to see an entire social universe grow so quickly, and in ways we often didn’t expect, all from the simple, stripped-down tool we call Landscape.

First of all, Landscape has been a success. We’ve gone from under 10 public groups when we launched OS1, to over 200 today. Those are the ones we know about; there are almost certainly more. 

It’s hard to generalize about the Urbit groups so far—they’re diverse. We have quite a few devoted to abstract philosophy and religion; but also to the nitty-gritty practicalities of homesteading, physical fitness, and tinkering with hardware. A few vague stereotypes have emerged: Urbit pilots tend to have big record collections. Mathematicians are overrepresented; so are people who actually finished Moby Dick. 

We’re not terribly surprised that there are groups devoted to cryptocurrency, electronic music, and chess. But there’s no way we could have anticipated the Internet Weirdness Task Force, or Urbit Yacht Club, or the Teahouse. Some things do appear to be eternal: it didn’t take long for groups devoted to cat pictures and anime to show up. 

Since we launched Landscape, we’ve added a lot of features (such as notifications, profiles, and Leap) and made great strides in reliability. There’s a lot more on the horizon. But even with limited features, the diversity of uses that we’ve seen people put Groups to confirms our belief that a general-purpose social tool, running on a general-purpose personal computer, is something a lot of people find useful. 

There are a surprising number of different combinations that can be made with the basic primitives of Chat, Notebooks, Collections. There are ‘read-only’ notebooks that approximate blogs, bulletin boards collecting links from the Earth web, and chatrooms pitched at different timezones. Some groups are intended to last a long time, others are ephemeral, tied to one-time events, or the lifespan of a particular project. Landscape makes this easy; you can spin up as many groups as you want. We’ve seen startups coordinating their day-to-day business over Landscape, book clubs and college classes logging their reading progress, and collaborative projects (in art, code, or prose) coalescing with participants from all over the world. 

The creativity of Urbit pilots in using Landscape’s collection of primitives for their own purposes is remarkable. So is the overall level of cordiality. Calm computing is real, and it goes down to the infrastructural layers. This isn’t to say that there are never heated arguments or disputes, but the few instances of rancor usually involve a ‘agree to disagree’ or with one person leaving a group, rather than the kind of protracted trolling and flame-warring often seen on centralized social platforms. 

It’s early days yet, but we’ve seen some interesting tweaks to the permissions suite and the different kinds of Urbit ID in order to provide differing levels of trust and anonymity. On the one hand, there are groups for galaxy and star holders, who attest to their ownership of these Urbit IDs in order to join. On the other, we saw an interesting experiment in ‘Comet Thunderdome’ under which anonymity was mandatory in order to provide a no-holds-barred environment. On a broader level, though, the fact that there are secret places on the network 

Intellectual or political siloing happens less than expected. This could change as the network grows — maybe our early adopters are just weird — but people are curious, and the fact that groups are user-owned makes for a genuine politeness that’s lacking in the corporate fishbowls of social media. There’s a difference between being a tourist in a country with weird laws and customs, and being suddenly stuck there without a way to go home. There’s also a subtle difference between an opt-in mentality, where you decide to only hang out in places that affirm your values, and an opt-out one, where you explore freely, and occasionally withdraw from a corner of the network where the dissonance between your values and the locals’ is just too great. We’ve thought about this gradual continuum of norms as a [likely emergent property of star-based communities](https://urbit.org/blog/the-missing-middle/), but it’s gratifying to see it showing up already in the wilds of the pilot-owned network. 

One might expect that the ability to leave a group and start your own results in lots of ragequits. The reality, as far as we’ve seen, is quite the opposite. We’re not sure if it’s because simply having the option makes people calmer, or because moderation isn’t outsourced to faraway corporate overlords, but even situations that do end with one person leaving tend towards the polite.

Many Landscape groups have different, sometimes very explicit rules for the kinds of conversation they want to foster. The range of tone is interesting; there are serious religious discussions and utterly anarchic shitposting—sometimes from the same people; the difference is the venue, and the ‘signs on the wall’ there. We think this is important, because one of the flattening effects of social media is to make every aspect of a given online identity legible across contexts. At its worst, this flattening creates online mobs, but even before things get that bad, our social relations suffer. The all-seeing eye over your behavior in a neighborhood group, event pages, and discussions with family members, coworkers, fellow hobbyists elide the fact that we’re all complicated people, and that our behavior and affect is necessary contextual. 

One of the cool things about starting your own network is that you get to actually see who started the first cat pictures group, who hacked their sigil to be a .gif first, who had the first membership-only community on Urbit. Stuff happens that we’ve never seen before. There are external communities of long standing who have migrated to Urbit; but some of the most active groups on Urbit were formed right there, in sudden flashes of inspiration and mutual interest in the UC Watercooler channel. Amazingly, we’ve already heard about the first marriage of two people who met in an Urbit chatroom!

While the design of Landscape is important in making a calm environment for the people who show up, it also plays a role in determining who shows up, and creates groups. The ability to start a group effortlessly means that lots of groups get started and don’t take off. Some of those that do, though, probably wouldn’t have gotten critical mass if they’d been subject to virality algorithms on a corporate social media platform. This extends to people, too. Some of the most active and respected members of multiple Urbit groups are people who would never in a million years be ‘social media personalities’. Landscape doesn’t reward superficial influencers—in contrast, it does provide a frictionless way for people who genuinely have a lot of ideas and energy to create rapidly expanding communities and content archives. 

Over time, we expect both opt-in Landscape features and entirely new, other clients to offer experiences closer to what we think of as social media. There’s room, on Urbit, for this too—the big differences that will persist have to do with both the way that each Urbit owner has control over their data, and the ease of homesteading anew if you don’t like the rules, not only of a community, but of an entire client. 

Landscape has a lot of features yet to incorporate, and there’s other work being done by both Tlon and community developers that has the potential to slot into Landscape in various ways ([WebRTC](https://grants.urbit.org/proposals/21131866-webrtc-gall-agent-and-external-app), i.e. p2p video connections mediated by Urbit IDs, is coming along nicely). But there’s also an entire universe of other potential ways to craft a client; each of those will perform its own speedrun, and discover its own quirks and challenges. 

The best way to experience both what the community has already built on Urbit, and see what’s possible, is to jump in and create a group yourself! Whatever you’re into can’t possibly be weirder than the Weirdness Unit. 

If you want to bounce group ideas off other pilots, check out the Community Formation channel in `~bitbet-bolbel/urbit-community`. 

To advertise your public group, go make a post in the Directory notebook in `~bollug-worlus/urbit-index`. 

Come start a group for you and your friends. It’s really that simple.
